### Reference Documentation
For further reference, please consider the following sections:
* https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2

# Create environment file
Edit .env with your Google OAuth credentials:
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local


# Run backend
mvn spring-boot:run

If the above command doesn't work on local, then try :
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com \
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx \
GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback \
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local \
mvn spring-boot:run

# Test API
Quick check to see if your backend is working by testing API
* curl http://localhost:8080/api/email/health
* curl http://localhost:8080/api/email/user-info
* Note: If you are not authenticated in Gmail API, then it will show: No session found


# Full Integration Testing:
* Start backend service on port 8080
* Start frontend service on port 3000
* Test OAuth flow end-to-end
* Upload Excel file and generate emails
